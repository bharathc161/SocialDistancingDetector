Ever thought how can we do this to minimise the spread of covid-19?
1st thought comes to the mind is how to get exact distance between any two or more person walking on a street?(lets say min distance is 1 meter)
Say we have street camera to monitor it. Hmm  again how do we get the distance?
  
Ever thought how did the camera on car while parking shows the bird view of the captured image?

We are gonna do bit similar. Thanks to OpenCV for PerspectiveTransform.
lets begin then!(see the source code for more details)

Still woking on Social Distancing Detector!

Any suggestions and improvement most welcome!
